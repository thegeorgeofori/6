                    you see some profound and heavily romantic stuff in books that sit with you.
                
            
                    one of said quotes is, "i fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly and then all at once".
                
            
                    i wont say i am in love with you just yet, but i sure am yawning a lot <3 </p>
